# Blockchan-Platforms
It took 7 years from the Bitcoin Genesis Block until Ethereum went Mainnet.  Now the technological floodgates are open with "trust" meeting "tech" meeting "social" meeting "big money" meeting "global movement" and on it goes......  We try to frame it up as certain directions take shape.

Among some of the top Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain Platfroms are the following:

  Zcash
  
ZCash is a privacy driven cryptocurrency. It uses the Equihash as an algorithm, which is an asymmetric memory-hard Proof of Work algorithm based on the generalized birthday problem. It relies on high RAM requirements to bottleneck the generation of proofs and making ASIC development unfeasible. 

ZCash uses  zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs) to ensure that all information (sender, reciever, ammount) is encrypted, without the possibility of double-spending. The only information that is revealed regarding transactions is the time in which they take place.
